# knife

A Work In Progress, mainly something to write whilst I get to grips with Go.  knife currently provides the following sub-modules:

 - aws - A module providing helper functions for AWS ( currently, very little )
 - files - Helper functions based on various os.path Python functions, for example, OSRename, OSDelete, OSPathExists
 - config - Eventually will provide similar functionality to Pythonâ€™s configparser module.
 - web - Helper functions when dealing with things on the web.
 
     `GetGoVersion() string` - Returns the version of Go as shown on golang.org
     
 - rss - Currently doesn't do anything but load OPML files.
 - dateutil - The beginnings of a library to make dealing with dates easier.

    `Now()` - Returns the current date / time as a time object
    
    `NextDay( startDate string, SUNDAY...SATURDAY ) time.Time` - returns the date of the next day from startDate 

    `GregorianEaster( year int ) time.Time` 

 - platform - somewhat similar to Python's platform module
 
     `Version` - returns the version of the currently installed Go
