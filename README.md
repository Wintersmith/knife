# knife

A Work In Progress, mainly something to write whilst I get to grips with Go.  knife currently provides the following sub-modules:

 - aws - A module providing helper functions for AWS ( currently, very little )
 - files - Helper functions based on various os.path Python functions, for example, OSRename, OSDelete, OSPathExists
 - config - Eventually will provide similar functionality to Pythonâ€™s configparser module.
 - web - Helper functions when dealing with things on the web.
